## ⚠️ Issues Preventing CI/CD from Running

### 🔴 CRITICAL: No GitHub Remote
**Issue**: Repository not connected to GitHub
**Impact**: Workflows cannot trigger
**Status**: Blocking all CI/CD functionality

**Fix**:
```bash
# 1. Create repository on GitHub
# 2. Connect local repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/Sneha-Martin18/LEARNOVA.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 🟡 MISSING: GitHub Secrets
**Required Secrets** (for deployment):
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` - Server SSH key
- `SERVER_HOST` - Server IP/hostname
- `SERVER_USER` - SSH username
- `DEPLOY_PATH` - Deployment directory
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK` - Slack notifications (optional)

**How to Add**:
1. GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Add each secret

### 🟡 INCOMPLETE: Deployment Commands
**Files**: `ci-cd.yml` (lines 233-236, 251-256)
**Issue**: Placeholder comments instead of actual deployment logic

**Current**:
```yaml
# Add your staging deployment commands here
# Add your production deployment commands here
```

**Needs**: Actual deployment scripts (kubectl, docker compose, SSH commands)

## 🎯 How to Verify CI/CD is Working

### Step 1: Connect to GitHub
```bash
# Create repo on GitHub first, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Check Actions Tab
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. You should see workflow runs starting

### Step 3: Monitor First Run
Watch for these jobs to complete:
- ✅ Lint (should pass)
- ⚠️ Test Services (may fail if no tests)
- ✅ Build Images (should pass)
- ✅ Security Scan (should pass)
- ⚠️ Integration Tests (may have issues)

### Step 4: Test with PR
```bash
git checkout -b test-branch
echo "test" >> test.txt
git add test.txt
git commit -m "test: CI/CD verification"
git push origin test-branch
```
Then create PR on GitHub and watch PR checks run.

## 🔧 Quick Fixes Needed

### Priority 1: Connect to GitHub
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/Sneha-Martin18/LEARNOVA.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Priority 2: Install Local Tools (for testing)
```bash
pip install black isort flake8 yamllint pytest
```

### Priority 3: Add Deployment Logic
Edit `ci-cd.yml` lines 233-236 and 251-256:

**For Docker Compose deployment**:
```yaml
- name: Deploy to staging
  run: |
    ssh ${{ secrets.SERVER_USER }}@${{ secrets.SERVER_HOST }} << 'EOF'
      cd ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_PATH }}
      docker compose pull
      docker compose up -d
    EOF
```

**For Kubernetes deployment**:
```yaml
- name: Deploy to staging
  run: |
    kubectl apply -f k8s/staging/
    kubectl rollout status deployment/api-gateway
```

### Priority 4: Configure Secrets
In GitHub: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

Add:
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `SERVER_HOST`
- `SERVER_USER`
- `DEPLOY_PATH`
