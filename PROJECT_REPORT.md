# Django Student Management System - Project Report

## Project Overview
The Django Student Management System is a comprehensive Learning Management System (LEARNOVA) built using Django 3.2.23. It provides a robust platform for managing educational institutions with separate interfaces for administrators, staff, and students.

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Django 3.2.23
- **Database**: SQLite3
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Payment Integration**: Razorpay
- **Authentication**: Custom Email Backend
- **File Storage**: Django's built-in media handling
- **Additional Libraries**:
  - django-extensions 3.2.3
  - Pillow 10.1.0 (for image processing)
  - pytz 2024.1 (timezone support)

- Role-based access control (Admin/HOD, Staff, Students)
- Email-based authentication system

### 2. Administrative Features
- User management (Students, Staff)
- Course and subject management
- Profile management
- Password management
- Administrative dashboard

### 3. Staff Features
- Attendance management
- Fine management system

- Custom middleware for login verification
- Secure password validation
- Session management

### 6. Additional Features
- Media file handling for profile pictures and documents
- Static file management
- Email notification system (configured for development)
- Timezone support

## System Architecture

### 1. Backend Structure
- Custom User Model
- Role-based middleware

- SQLite database for data persistence

### 2. Frontend Organization
- Separate template directories for different user roles:
  - HOD templates
  - Staff templates
  - Student templates

### 3. Payment Integration
- Razorpay payment gateway integration
- Test environment configuration

## Deployment Configuration
- Debug mode enabled (for development)
- Configured for Azure Web Apps deployment
- Static and media file serving configured
- Email backend set to console (development mode)

## Security Considerations
1. Production deployment requires:
   - Secure SECRET_KEY configuration
   - Debug mode disabled
   - Proper SMTP configuration
   - Secure Razorpay key management
   - Database migration to production-grade system

## Future Enhancements
1. SMTP email configuration for production
2. Enhanced payment gateway features
3. Advanced reporting system
4. API integration capabilities
5. Performance optimization for larger datasets

## Project Status
The system is currently in development phase with core features implemented and ready for testing. Production deployment will require additional security configurations and optimizations.
