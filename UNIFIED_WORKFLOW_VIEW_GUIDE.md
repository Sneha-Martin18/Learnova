# Unified CI/CD Workflow View Guide

## Problem: Can't See All Workflow Jobs in One Place

When you have 60+ pull requests, GitHub's interface makes it difficult to see all CI/CD workflow jobs in a unified view. Jobs are scattered across different PRs, making it hard to get an overview of your pipeline status.

## Solution: Unified Workflow Dashboard

This repository now includes tools to view **all workflow jobs in a single consolidated view**, regardless of how many PRs you have.

---

## üéØ Quick Start

### Option 1: Shell Script (Fast & Simple)
```bash
./view_workflow_summary.sh
```

### Option 2: Python Dashboard (Rich & Detailed)
```bash
python3 workflow_status_dashboard.py
```

## üîç Viewing Specific Workflow Runs

### View by Branch
```bash
gh run list --workflow=ci-cd.yml --branch main --limit 10
```

### View by Status
```bash
# Failed runs only
gh run list --workflow=ci-cd.yml --status failure

# Successful runs only
gh run list --workflow=ci-cd.yml --status success
```

### View Specific Run
```bash
# Get run ID from the dashboard output
gh run view <run-id>

# View in browser
gh run view <run-id> --web

# View logs
gh run view <run-id> --log

# View only failed logs
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```

---

## üåê Alternative: GitHub Actions Tab

You can also view workflows directly in GitHub:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the **"Actions"** tab
3. Select **"CI/CD Pipeline"** from the left sidebar
4. Click on any workflow run to see all jobs

**Direct URL format:**
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/actions
```

This bypasses the PR view entirely and shows all workflow runs.

---

## üí° Best Practices

### 1. Regular Monitoring
```bash
# Check latest status daily
./view_workflow_summary.sh

# Or set up an alias
alias cicd-status='cd /path/to/repo && ./view_workflow_summary.sh'
```

### 2. Watch Live Workflows
```bash
# Watch the latest workflow in real-time
gh run watch

# Watch specific workflow
gh run watch <run-id>
```

### 3. Quick Failure Investigation
```bash
# View only failed job logs
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed

# Rerun failed jobs
gh run rerun <run-id> --failed
```

### 4. Filter by Time
```bash
# Runs from last 24 hours
gh run list --workflow=ci-cd.yml --created ">=2025-10-23"

# Runs from specific date range
gh run list --workflow=ci-cd.yml --created "2025-10-20..2025-10-24"
```

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No workflow runs found"

**Solution:**
1. Check if workflows have been triggered:
   ```bash
   gh run list --limit 50
   ```
2. Verify workflow file exists:
   ```bash
   ls -la .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
   ```
3. Check if workflow is enabled in GitHub Settings

### Issue: "GitHub CLI not authenticated"

**Solution:**
```bash
gh auth login
# Follow the prompts to authenticate
```

### Issue: Can't see recent runs

**Solution:**
```bash
# Increase limit
gh run list --workflow=ci-cd.yml --limit 50

# Or view all runs
gh run list --workflow=ci-cd.yml --limit 100
```

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Compare Multiple Runs

# Compare success rates
for run_id in $(gh run list --workflow=ci-cd.yml --limit 5 --json databaseId --jq '.[].databaseId'); do
    echo "Run #$run_id:"
    gh run view $run_id --json jobs --jq '[.jobs[] | select(.conclusion == "success")] | length'
done
```

### Export Workflow Data
```bash
# Export to JSON
gh run view <run-id> --json jobs > workflow_data.json

# Export to CSV (requires jq)
gh run view <run-id> --json jobs | jq -r '.jobs[] | [.name, .conclusion, .startedAt, .completedAt] | @csv' > workflow_data.csv
```

### Monitor Specific Job
```bash
# Find job ID
gh run view <run-id> --json jobs --jq '.jobs[] | select(.name == "Build Docker Images") | .id'

# View job logs
gh run view --job <job-id> --log
```

## üìä Integration with Other Tools

### Use with PR Management
```bash
# 1. Clean up old PRs
./bulk_close_prs.sh

# 2. View unified workflow status
./view_workflow_summary.sh

# 3. Check specific workflow for a branch
gh run list --branch feature/new-feature
```

### Combine with CI/CD Status Checker
```bash
# Check overall CI/CD health
python check_cicd_status.py

# Then view detailed workflow
python3 workflow_status_dashboard.py
```
